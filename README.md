# Javascript-Calculator
One of the Advanced Front End Development Projects for Free Code Camp

Build a Javascript Calculator with the following functions:
- Add, Subtract, Multiply and Divide two numbers
- Clear the input field with the clear button
- Be able to keep chaining mathematical operations together until the equal button is pressed

Extra functions:
- Allow to chain operators (overwrites the initial operator)
- Display up to 8 characters in the screen current value
- Display up to 25 characters in screen history value
- You don't need to clear before doing the next calculation. After calculation, allows you to immediately type in your next expression instead of clearing first if you don't want to chain anymore operators
- Doesn't allow more than one decimal point
- Operator precedence works
